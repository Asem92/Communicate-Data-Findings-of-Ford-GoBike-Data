# Communicate-Data-Findings-of-Ford-GoBike-Data
This document explores a dataset containing Ford bikers for approximately 183,500 Ford gobikes of start and end station locations.

There are 183,412 Ford gobike in the dataset with 16 features (duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude, end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender, and bike_share_for_all_trip). 
Based on the dataset's structure, I would say that the main feature of interest is the duration_sec column, which represents the duration of each trip in seconds. This feature can provide insights into trip patterns, user behavior, and bike usage.
